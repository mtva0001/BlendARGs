This repository contains scripts that have been used during the BlendARGs project. The project aimed to investigate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) in both marine and freshwater environments. 

The scripts utilize a publicly available tool called MetaCHIP to detect putative HGT events and the involved genes. 
Functional annotation of genes have been done by using DeepNOG (db: eggNOG5). The detection of ARGs were done by (1) using RGI with the CARD database and (2) BLASTP against the ResFinderFG2.0 database.
