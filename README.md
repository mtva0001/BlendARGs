This repository contains scripts that have been used during the BlendARGs project with the aim to investigate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) in both marine and freshwater environments. 

The scripts utilize a publicly available tool called [MetaCHIP](https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP) to detect putative HGT events and the involved genes. 
Functional annotation of genes have been done by using [DeepNOG](https://github.com/univieCUBE/deepnog) (db: eggNOG5). The detection of ARGs were done by (1) using [RGI](https://github.com/arpcard/rgi) with the CARD database and (2) BLASTP against the [ResFinderFG2.0 database](https://github.com/RemiGSC/ResFinder_FG_Construction)
